# TODO

- [ ] Add a way of copying a prompt from the cli, by choosing a blueprint, and getting a high level overview of prompts (so we can select which we want, e.g. 003_codex_expert_implementer.md). We can use `pbcopy` (assume we are on mac)
- [ ] Implement real AI model integrations
- [ ] Expand prompt generation logic
- [ ] Flesh out brainstorming algorithms
- [ ] Implement summarization techniques
- [ ] Persist events for later microservice extraction
- [ ] Extend CLI with user arguments
